The tendency of all the virtues to produce pleasure is a topic that will be treated in its own place later on. At present I shall proceed to expound the essence and qualities of pleasure itself, and shall endeavor to remove the misconceptions of ignorance and to make you realize how serious, how temperate, how austere is the school that is supposed to be sensual, lax and luxurious.\"\n            - \"The pleasure we pursue is not that kind alone which directly affects our physical being with a delightful feeling, — a positively agreeable perception of the senses; on the contrary, the greatest pleasure according to us is that which is experienced as a result of the complete removal of pain. When we are released from pain, the mere sensation of complete emancipation and relief from uneasiness is in itself a source of gratification. But everything that causes gratification is a pleasure (just as everything that causes annoyance is a pain). Therefore the complete removal of pain has correctly been termed a pleasure. For example, when hunger and thirst are banished by food and drink, the mere fact of getting rid of uneasiness brings a resultant pleasure in its train. So generally, the removal of pain causes pleasure to take its place.\"\n            - \"Epicurus consequently maintained that there is no such thing as a neutral state of feeling intermediate between pleasure and pain; for the state supposed by some thinkers to be neutral, being characterized as it is by entire absence of pain, is itself, he held, a pleasure, and, what is more, a pleasure of the highest order.\"\n            - \"A man who is conscious of his condition at all must necessarily feel pleasure or pain. But complete absence of pain Epicurus considers to be the limit and highest point of pleasure; beyond this point pleasure may vary in kind, but it cannot vary in intensity or degree.\"\n            - \"The truth of the position that pleasure is the ultimate good will most readily appear from the following illustration. Let us imagine a man living in the continuous enjoyment of numerous and vivid pleasures alike of body and of mind, undisturbed either by the presence or the prospect of pain: what possible state of existence could we describe as being more excellent or more desirable?\"\n            - \" One so situated must possess in the first place a strength of mind that is proof against all fear of death or of pain; he will know that death means complete unconsciousness, and that pain is generally light if long and short if strong, so that its intensity is compensated by brief duration and its continuance by diminishing severity.\"\n  - trigger: \">2elorem\"\n    replace: \"{{one}} {{two}}\"\n    vars:\n      - name: one\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \">elorem\"\n      - name: two\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \">elorem\"\n  - trigger: \">3lorem\"\n    replace: \"{{two}} {{three}}\"\n    vars:\n      - name: two\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \">2elorem\"\n      - name: three\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \">elorem\"\n  - trigger: \">4lorem\"\n    replace: \"{{three}} {{four}}\"\n    vars:\n      - name: three\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \">2elorem\"\n      - name: four\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \">2elorem\"\n  - trigger: \"#2elorem\"\n    replace: |-\n      {{one}}\n      {{two}}\n    vars:\n      - name: one\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \"#elorem\"\n      - name: two\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \"#elorem\"\n  - trigger: \"#3elorem\"\n    replace: |-\n      {{two}}\n      {{three}}\n    vars:\n      - name: two\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \"#2elorem\"\n      - name: three\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \"#elorem\"\n  - trigger: \"#4elorem\"\n    replace: |-\n      {{three}}\n      {{four}}\n    vars:\n      - name: three\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \"#2elorem\"\n      - name: four\n        type: match\n        params:\n          trigger: \"#2elorem\"\n"}],"license":{"_tag":"None"},"serializedReadme":{"compiledSource":"var s=Object.defineProperty,N=Object.defineProperties;var g=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var l=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var d=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,i=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var p=(t,a,n)=>a in t?s(t,a,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:n}):t[a]=n,e=(t,a)=>{for(var n in a||(a={}))d.call(a,n)&&p(t,n,a[n]);if(l)for(var n of l(a))i.call(a,n)&&p(t,n,a[n]);return t},o=(t,a)=>N(t,g(a));var m=(t,a)=>{var n={};for(var r in t)d.call(t,r)&&a.indexOf(r)<0&&(n[r]=t[r]);if(t!=null&&l)for(var r of l(t))a.indexOf(r)<0&&i.call(t,r)&&(n[r]=t[r]);return n};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(n){var r=n,{components:t}=r,a=m(r,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,o(e(e({},layoutProps),a),{components:t,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"h1\",null,\"README\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"english-lorem\"),` is a simple package to generate random lorem ipsum sentences\nor paragraphs but in English!
